# Replanted-Improvements
This Repository is a series of bugfixes, QOL changes, and modded content for Plants Vs. Zombies: Replanted! Hopefully turning it into the Remaster we never got!

Note: This project isn't made in ill-will. I understand that Replanted's development was insanely rushed and made by an inexperienced team. This project is just an attempt to make Replanted more appealing for modders.

## Project Structure
This repositiory will be only used to the main project, the other projects will have separate repositories, and each repository will be linked here.

## How to Contribute
The best place to go is the PvZ1 Modding Discord (linked below) to get in touch and see what needs to be done. However, you can also message me (BobTheNerd10) on Twitter, send me an e-mail, or (for programming only) create a GitHub pull request!

To suggest ideas for the project and report bugs, either get in contact with me or make a suggestion on the Google Sheet (linked below!)

## Links
[This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10N_Q6xMBUn9X6yh2J6AfADarAxr983ox4QMMI-m2s5A/edit?usp=sharing) is currently being used to track oversights that will be fixed in this project. It also stores a list of new content that will be added! (The new content will only be something typical for a remaster. There won't be any new plants, zombies, or worlds for example (with the exception of reimplemented features from the PvZ1 beta, and Chinese-exclusive content ported over.))

At the moment, all discussion related to this project is happening in the [PvZ1 Modders Association discord](https://discord.gg/cGBwQQaC7m) in a post titled "Mod(s) to fix PvZ Replanted" in the #mod-hub forum. However, this project may get its own discord one day!
