# Replanted-Improvements
This Repository is a series of bugfixes, QOL changes, and modded content for Plants Vs. Zombies: Replanted

## Structure
At the moment, this Repository contains two C# projects.
- Extra-Polish is the project dedicated to fixing all the oversights in the game. 
- PvZ-Logging is just a dev tool to help analyze the game's internals in real time. It's only meant for mod develeopers.

More C# projects will be added as needed.
