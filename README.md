# Replanted-Improvements
This Repository is a series of bugfixes, QOL changes, and modded content for Plants Vs. Zombies: Replanted

[This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10N_Q6xMBUn9X6yh2J6AfADarAxr983ox4QMMI-m2s5A/edit?usp=sharing) is currently being used to track oversights that will be fixed in this project. It also stores a list of new content that will be added! (The new content will only be something typical for a remaster. There won't be any new plants, zombies, or worlds for example (with the exception of reimplemented features from the PvZ1 beta, and Chinese-exclusive content ported over.))

At the moment, all discussion related to this project is happening in the [PvZ1 Modders Association discord](https://discord.gg/cGBwQQaC7m) in a post titled "Mod(s) to fix PvZ Replanted" in the #mod-hub forum. However, this project may get its own discord one day!

## Project Structure
At the moment, this Repository contains two C# projects.
- Extra-Polish is the project dedicated to fixing all the oversights in the game. 
- PvZ-Logging is just a dev tool to help analyze the game's internals in real time. It's only meant for mod developers.

More C# projects will be added as needed.
