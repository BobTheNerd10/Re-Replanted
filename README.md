# Re-Replanted
This project is a series of mods that implement bugfixes, QOL changes, and modded content for Plants Vs. Zombies: Replanted! 
The goal is to make Replanted more "complete", hopefully turning it into the remaster we never got!

Note: This project isn't made in ill-will. I understand that Replanted's development was insanely rushed and made by an inexperienced team. This project is just an attempt to make Replanted more appealing for both modders and (disappointed) players.

Note: The name is TBD

## Project Structure
At the moment, this Repository contains one C# project.
- Core-Fixes is the project dedicated to fixing all the oversights in the game. 

More C# projects will be added as needed.

## How to Help / Making Suggestions
There are several different ways to help! And I greatly appreciate anyone who takes the time to! :D
- For a To-do List, check out the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10N_Q6xMBUn9X6yh2J6AfADarAxr983ox4QMMI-m2s5A/edit?usp=sharing) of Replanted's issues that need to be fixed! (It's also linked below.) 
- To suggest ideas/bug fixes for the project, either contact me (see below), make a suggestion on the Google Spreadsheet, or create a GitHub issue! I'd love to hear your opinions, and the data is always useful! 
- If you want to help code, it's best if you get in contact with me (see below), but you can also just create a GitHub pull request with your code changes! Pull requests made without my knowledge will likely take longer to be approved though unfortunately D:

To contact me personally (BobTheNerd10):
- It's best if you send me an e-mail (BobTheNerd10@gmail.com) or talk to me personally over Discord! (My username is @BobTheNerd10, but it's preferable if you head to the [PvZ1 Modders Association discord](https://discord.gg/cGBwQQaC7m) in a post titled "Mod(s) to fix PvZ Replanted" in the #mod-hub forum. That's the main location for discussing the mod, and I'm quite active there!)
- You can also message me on Reddit (u/BobTheNerd10) and Twitter (@BobTheNerd10), but I'm less active in those places, so I might miss you :<
